# Facebook SDK for Android

Integrate with Facebook to help you build engaging social apps and get more installs.  The Facebook Android SDK includes many features to allow you to integrate social within your own apps:

 - **Login** Let people easily sign in to your app with their Facebook identity. If they have already signed in on the Facebook for Android app, they don't have to reenter their username and password.
