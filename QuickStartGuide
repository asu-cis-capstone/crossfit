Quick Start Guide

1. Download Xamarin Studio to your machine. It’s necessary that you use their “Indie” subscription. In many cases, the Xamarin download will take a few tries. It’s important to make sure that the Android SDK is fully downloaded, which you may have to do separately. 

2. Connect Xamarin to the repo at the following address: https://github.com/asu-cis-capstone/crossfit/

3. Within the entire WodstarMobileApp .sln file you will find two separate projects WodstarMobileApp.Droid & WodstarMobileApp.iOS. Unless you are working on a Mac, you will not be able to render any of the iOS layouts.
